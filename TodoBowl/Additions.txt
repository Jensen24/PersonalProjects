Tapes = Text Shapes

Priority:
- Update Bowl:
    To sit properly in center
    To being a decemt size (not too big/too little)
    update pixels so the bowl is not blurry
- Make Matter walls in shape of bowl
- update spawn location of Tapes to drop directly above bowl
    (Currently does, but bowl needs to be shifted)
- Make Tapes draggable 
Do Later:
- Update CSS
- Choose a Theme (Multiple themes?)
- Add more flavor text
- Update shape of text
- Make each entered Tapes vary in shapes depending on length
    (small<10>medium<15>large)
- Add a "Clear all" button
- Add a "Completed" Button on Tapes
